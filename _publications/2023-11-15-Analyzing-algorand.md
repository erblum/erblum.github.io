The Algorand blockchain uses a consensus algorithm based on the Algorand family of consensus protocols by Micali et al. Deploying the protocol in practice requires a variety of modifications and engineering decisions that impact the protocol's security in non-trivial ways. Our analysis accounts for these various changes, giving the first comprehensive security analysis of the real-world protocol.
