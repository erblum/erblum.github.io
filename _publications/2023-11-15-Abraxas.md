collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2023-11-21-Abraxas
excerpt: 'This paper (with Jonathan Katz, Julian Loss, Kartik Nayak, and Simon Ochsenreither) proposes Abraxas, a generic approach for constructing hybrid state-machine replication (SMR) protocols from any standard "fast path" and asynchronous "slow path." Our design uses an "always on" slow path to improve performance when switching modes frequently.'
