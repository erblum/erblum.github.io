I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/). 

Prior to joining Reed in Fall 2023, I received my PhD in 2023 from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/), where I was advised by Jonathan Katz. Before that, I received an undergraduate degree in Mathematics from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/) in 2018.

My research is in cryptography, focusing on distributed consensus and secure multiparty computation.
